This data project analyzes crime rates over the past 20 years and compares them to the political party in control. The goal is to investigate whether there is any correlation between violent crime rates and the political party in power in different states.

## Introduction

The project focuses on examining crime rates in the context of political party governance. Specifically, it aims to answer questions such as:
- Are there noticeable trends in crime rates over the past 20 years?
- Is there a correlation between violent crime rates and the political party in control?
- How do the top three states with the highest crime rates correlate with the political party in office?

## Data Files

The following data files are included in this repository:
- `dataFiles/crimes.dataset.csv`
- `dataFiles/crimes.dataset.xlsx`
- `dataFiles/united_states_governors_1775_2020.csv`
- `dataFiles/us_presidents.csv`
- `dataFiles/violent_crime_rates_all_years.csv`

These datasets contain crime-related crime rates by state, national rates and the past 20 years of the Presidents and Governors,that will be used for this analysis.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:

# Crime-and-Politics This is a data project that will look at the crime rates over the past 20 years and compare these crime rates to the 20 years that Democrats and Republicans that hold office. I will see if there is any increase or decrease in violent crimes to different states that have been ran by either political party. I will take the top five states that have the highest crime rates of the last 20 years and see if there is any correlation to the political party that is in control at the that time.
