# Crime-and-Politics This is a data project that will look at the crime rates over the past 20 years and compare these crime rates to the 20 years that Democrats and Republicans that hold office. I will see if there is any increase or decrease in violent crimes to different states that have been ran by either political party. I will take the top five states that have the highest crime rates of the last 20 years and see if there is any correlation to the political party that is in control at the that time.
